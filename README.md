* I will definitely want to make the filter for searching and filtering through the car selection.
* Make a purchasing page.
* Rerendering issue for the AddCar function and finish update and delete for the AddCar model.
* Populate the table on profile page with purchased cars.
* Setup a comment section for each car for all users to talk to one another.
* Incorporate Vin# to hunt down the real specs of the car. Might be able to get an -api.
* Later on even a google maps popup modal to get the cars location showing on google maps.
